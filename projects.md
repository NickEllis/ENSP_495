# List of demonstrations for ENSP 338 and ENSP 438

This special study class has the goal of preparing students for hands on
work at the intersection of software, hardware, and energy.  Students
will design, fabricate, verify, and document demonstrations for use in
classes on electrical energy consumption and generation.
Outputs of this work will include plans for others to easily replicate these
designs for use in other classes.

This document lists some candidate projects for completion during the
semester.

## Solar curve tracer

This device will allow for the simultaneous measurement of the voltage
and current from a solar panel under different loads.  This will allow
students to recreate the IV curves at different illumination levels.

Materials:

- Shunt resistor
- Load resistors
- Multimeters
- Terminal blocks


## Insolation datalogger

Use a datalogger and thermopile to collect insolation data.

## Three phase generator

Hand cranked three phase generator

Materials

- Axial bearing setup
- dowels and skate bearings?
- copper wire
- nails


## Three phase motor


## Stepper motor demonstration

Simulate the principle of a brushless dc motor or stepper motor.  This
involves the creation of a set of poles and a way to switch the
currents.  Students will be able to manually apply a power supply
current and see the step-by-step rotation of the compass needle.

Materials:

- round compass
- coils
- manual switching board

## AC current metering

Test fixture to allow direct banana plug access to the AC current on the
neutral line to be measured in a multimeter.


## AC metering setup (high current)

Materials:

- Current transformer
- Voltage transformer
- McMaster plug setup with wires



## AC metering setup (low current)

Materials:

- Variac
- Isolation transformer
- Shunt and amp?
- Transformer isolation?


## Bridge Rectifier


## Power factor demonstration device

Uses AC motor and capacitor to demonstrate power factor improvement and
relation to current draw.

## Battery charge and discharge monitor

Uses DAQ to measure current and voltage being supplied to a battery.

## Downloading NOAA Data

Pull data from NOAA (NCDC, QCLCD, USRCRN) and plot, calculate degree
days, peak sun hours.

## Install wireless internet connected weather station

Install commercially available weather station near ETC to allow for
real time monitoring of weather conditions and correlation with building
performance.  Possible product: Davis Instruments Weather Station.
